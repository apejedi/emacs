* Algorithmic beats
Have a function that given a few parameters
parameters



creates a pattern which fits in a 4 beat pattern and "fits/aligns?"
conditions
starts and ends on strong beats or aligns with the start and end of base beat
size is multiple of of base beat (most important?)

the created pattern would either come in on a on-beat/off-beat
and repeat only every n cycles


* Material
Have a distinct goal for each session

Need fully fleshed out tracks
with atleast three transitions/phases

Spend long time on each track
idea is to add and shape elements until it becomes a whole

Make beat sequencer layout


** Paramterized patterns
A function which returns a pattern using the given parameters
a callable synth similar to defsynth? easy to specify defaults
m-args, phase


** techno track
1 make a tb-303 instrument and make it usable
2 gather samples or percussion instruments
3 analyze and work on rhythms

timbres elements closely tied to drums

with bass, harsh timbres
fast tempo beats and syncopation



* Songs
blues run the game
on
salt remains
shaking hand
x-naut fortress
glower
lumen
pyramid song




* Stochastic phrases
Add logic to create phrases stochastically
start with a base phrase
apply transformations probabilistcally
1 reverse
2 sputter
3 shuffle actions within a local area
4 jump octaves

sputter/shuffle only for non-empty actions?
