** Overtone vs SuperCollider
| Overtone                      | SuperCollider                                       |
| Has only at-at for scheduling | Has patterns                                        |
| can use emacs and repl        |                                                     |
| Has namespaces etc            | More verbose? Files could become large and unwieldy |


Stick with overtone for now

** Timing
*** Pulse Input signals
won't work with existing synthdefs

** Percussion
Investigate if synths inside other synths can be triggered using signals

Analyze how overtone constructs and loads synths on server

** Bass

** Melodic motifs

** Harmonic intervention
