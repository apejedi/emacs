You should take no action unwillingly, selfishly, uncritically, or with conflicting motives.
Do not dress up your thoughts in smart finery: do not be a gabbler or a meddler.
Further, let the god that is within you be the champion of the being you are - one who has taken his post like a soldier waiting for the Retreat from life to sound,
and ready to depart, past the need for any loyal oath or human witness.
And see that you keep a cheerful demeanour, and retain your independence of outside help and the peace which others can give.
Your duty is to stand straight - not held straight.

Nothing is so conducive to greatness of mind as the ability to subject each element of our experience in life to methodical and truthful examination,
always at the same time using this scrutiny as a means to reflect on the nature of the universe, the contribution any given action or event makes to that nature,
the value this has for the Whole, and the value it has for man - and man is an inhabitant of this highest City, of which all other cities are mere households.

Out of the night that covers me,
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate,
I am the captain of my soul.

One thing that I have realized only in the last 2 years or so though is that to be happy, you must DO THINGS. Anything. As long as it's what you want to do, and only for your own sake.

One day you look around you. Your body is wrinkled and squeaky and you hurt.
The book is a yellowed, useless lump; the building is caving in.
So you pine for lost youth and you cry when the possessions are gone. Where does this pain come from? It comes from your own inattention.
You failed to look closely at life. You failed to observe the constantly shifting flow of the world as it went by.
You set up a collection of mental constructions, 'me', 'the book', 'the building', and you assumed that they would endure forever.
They never do. But you can tune into the constantly ongoing change. You can learn to perceive your life as an ever- flowing movement, a thing of great beauty like a dance or symphony.
You can learn to take joy in the perpetual passing away of all phenomena. You can learn to live with the flow of existence rather than running perpetually against the grain.
You can learn this. It is just a matter of time and training.


self-discipline is different. It's
the skill of seeing through the hollow shouting of your own impulses and piercing their
secret. They have no power over you. It's all a show, a deception. Your urges scream and
bluster at you; they cajole; they coax; they threaten; but they really carry no stick at all.
You give in out of habit. You give in because you never really bother to look beyond the
threat. It is all empty back there. There is only one way to learn this lesson, though. The
words on this page won't do it. But look within and watch the stuff coming up --
restlessness, anxiety, impatience, pain-- just watch it come up and don't get involved.
Much to your surprise, it will simply go away. It rises, it passes away. As simple as that.
There is another word for 'self-discipline'. It is 'Patience'.

Important thing is to work on it as an experiment, the outcomes are irrelevant compared to the tests themselves
But the work HAS TO BE DONE, NO ROOM FOR ANY DOUBT

Did you challenge yourself?
Did you get out of your comfort zone?


Who do I aspire to be
- One who does not compare one's circumstances/oneself with others
- One who is not overly affected by what others are doing, have done or will do
- One who acts and behaves according to one's own intuition and principles
- One who is always mindful of what one is doing and always steering oneself to achieve one's goals (small innocous decisions add up over time)
- One who does not balk at hard decisions/failure and has the courage to take what looks like the best action
- One who does not distract oneself with petty pleasures
- One who enjoys challenges and pursuits knowing that they will bring reward and knowledge
- One who does not bow down/open up/attempt to please or make sacrifice for others unless they have earned one's respect
- One who is not completely dependent on others for one's sense of fulfillment/worth
- Who pursues music relentlessly


Focus on changing your self image, nobody will respect you if you don't respect yourself.


I want to be performing or be part of a music collective by this time next year
Will need hundreds of hours of study
Work and master sight reading
Go to Europe next year
I cannot stagnate, I have to be awake, don't go to sleep, keep moving

Stop comparing and fretting, it is pointless.
What you are doing now is infinitely more important than where you will be and where you have been
You can stay at the surface and look at pretty seashells or you can dive into the deep and look at the face of eternity

Personal transformation
Start from within kill anxiety and slowly start making changes in your life. Meditation is medicine, it's rehab, do it frequently and regularly
Take it slowly, step by step, doing too many things at once would just lead to failure, patience, belief

First step is to see things as they are without fear, longing
Let your calm true self be the one at the helm
Expectations weigh you down, you are fearful to work towards music because you feel too left behind and because you might fail
Bleed out your ego, anxiety and learn to submerge yourself in learning
Learn to be comfortable with failure, confusion.
Always remember why you are pursuing it, to learn for its sake and discovery
To slowly start fashioning sounds which are an expression of you

Trying to do something because you should (guilting?) has failed without exception
Pursue something solely for yourself because that is what will bring happiness
Believe in your choice, believe that it will lead you to a new experience, a new sensation and perhaps a new happiness
Believe in yourself, believe that you can walk that path, that you can overcome all doubt,distractions and obstacles
